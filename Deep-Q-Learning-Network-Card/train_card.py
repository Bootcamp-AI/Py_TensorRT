Deep Learning Reinforcement Tutorial: Deep Q Network (DQN) = Combination of Deep Learning and Q-Learning Tutorial
 
The class DeepQLearning implements the Deep Q Network (DQN) Reinforcement Learning Algorithm.
The implementation is based on the OpenAI Gym Cart Pole environment and TensorFlow (Keras) machine learning library
