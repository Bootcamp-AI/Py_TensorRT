#  This is Resnet 18 classification task based onnx and tensorrt


#### Attention...
### In order to implement this codes, you need to follow course with docker file configurations in order to achieve library dependencies well built. 
```
1. file which is called convert_onnx_to_engineresnet

	Basically, convert onnx file format to tensorrt for resnet 18 pretrained model

2. file export.py downloads resnet18 file that exports model as onnx file format

3. file inference resnet files can be used for making inference on gpu based devicie with tensorrt file format

	
```
